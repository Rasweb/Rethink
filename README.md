# From-Graphic_Profile-To-Web_Projects

From Graphic profile to Web Projects

This is my second assignment for Graphic design at Medieinstitutet. I have used the Graphic profile from the Rasmus.Palm.G.Profil, where I created a Lettermark logo.

---

In the Assets map you can find the images and SVGs I used for the creation of the website in the img folder. You can also find the Illustrator folder in the Assets map.

---

In the Ilustrator folder you can find two folders, Mockups and Wireframes. You can also find the pdf to my logo and the website layout and also an Adobe Illustrator file.

---

In the Mockups folder you can find the mockups i created for the website using Illustrator. All the files are png files and there are files for desktop, ipad, mobile and a bigger pitcure with every mockup in it.

In the Wireframes folder you can find the wireframes for desktop, ipad and mobile these were also create using Illustrator and are png files.

Here you can find a screenshot of the design and you can also see it live here:
